# Sketchpad
Sketchpad is a c++ application that allows users to generate extremely simple drawings on the screen. Consider a sketchpad with a pen, where every movement causes lines to be created once the pen is pressed down. Lifting and moving the pen, on the other hand, prevents any drawing while allowing the pen to be positioned in a new spot on the pad. The operation of the pen movement is replicated in this program, resulting in a computerized sketchpad.
